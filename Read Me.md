How to Play:

* Each player takes turns drawing lines between two dots
* Strategically its best to avoid adding a third side to any box
*  Once a box can be closed (all 4 box borders are drawn) the player who draws the final border fills the box and gains a point also maintaining their turn.
*  play continues until all boxes are filled and all the game borders are drawn


User Stories:

* As a player, I want to know which players turn it is
* As a player, I want to know which color pertains to my marker
* As a player, I want to see my current score as the game progresses

Technologies:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Jquery

Future Implementation:

* Make the game scalable to any size gameboard user desires
* implement a reset function that sets all values to zero instead of reloading page
* make game board layout more responsive for mobile browser play
