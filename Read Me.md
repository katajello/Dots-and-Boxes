How to Play:

* Select the size game you and a friend want to play
* Each player takes turns drawing lines between two dots
* Strategically its best to avoid adding a third side to any box
*  Once a box can be closed (all 4 box borders are drawn) the player who draws the final border fills the box and gains a point also maintaining their turn. 
*  play continues until all boxes are filled and all the game borders are drawn
